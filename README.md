# Password-cracker
This project is a model based on how dictionary attacks are performed an dit uses "hashlib" module from python in order to generate the md5 hashing and maps it to the given hash.
The basic idea is if you are having an hash-digest and wanted to know the original password there may be a chance to find as this project has a text file called "passwords.txt" which has the list of top 12000 used passwords and the chance of finding the password for given hash is higher
This is a small scale dictionary attack and should be only used for educational purposes.
